# StreamFlex
I've crafted a state-of-the-art streaming platform using React, Redux, and Vite for seamless performance. Leveraging the TMDb API, users can effortlessly explore a wide range of movies and TV shows. jQuery enhances interactivity, while Vite ensures swift builds. The result? An engaging platform that delivers a diverse entertainment experience.
